# Reddit clone app built with React Native and Expo

## Setup
Follow [the official documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to setup Expo and React Native environment.

To run the app on iOS simulator:
```
yarn ios 
```

To test the production app on your phone(iOS/Android), follow the [link](https://expo.io/@aleksefo/reddit-climate-action-plan)

You need to install Expo client on your phone and send yourself a link through email or phone. (Or use QR code if you have Android).


## Extra info

The project is quite simple, so I opted to use Expo for simple prototyping and for easier testing of the assignment.
If it was a real app, I would use plain React Native with TypeScript, Redux, React Navigation etc.

In addition to minimum requirements, I added:

-sorting based on Hot,New,Top

-small header animation when user scrolls the list

-splash screen and app icons


If I had more time I would:

-add testing

-add more animations

-add authentication with OAuth
